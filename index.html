<h5 id="cpss-imaging-database">CPSS IMAGING DATABASE</h5>
<p>The CPSS Imaging Database is an image data and metadata management system for digital pathology, in-vivo, and mass spectrometry imaging designed around a BPMN engine (Camunda Zeebe). Its purpose is to gather metadata from services internally – such as eSlide Manager, bioELN – and externally, such as BSI – before combining these data with metadata extracted from image files (in various formats: SVS, NDPI, bif, DICOM), transforming it using JSONata, and storing in Dgraph.</p>
<h6 id="key-achievements-2">Key Achievements:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Lead on the design and building of infrastructure in AWS CDK for deploying more than 15 services to AWS Fargate. Services included: Camunda Zeebe; Camunda Operate; Elastic Search &amp; Kibana; Dgraph</li>

<li>Assumed Scrum Master role. Facilitated daily Stand-up events and regular Backlog Refinement events.</li>
</ul>
<p>My time served across these projects has resulted in my becoming very confident around Medical and Whole Slide Imaging. Particularly DICOM and WSI formats supported by BioFormats. However, most instrumental in my achievements here have been the relationships I’ve built across many departments including CSIS, TTA, Precision Medicine, Networks, Architecture, Cyber Security, DevOps not to mention the dedicated AWS Concierge Team.</p>
